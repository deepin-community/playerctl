## Version 0.5.0

Version 0.5.0 includes some new features.

New features:

- Add workaround for Spotify to get metadata
- Add `position` cli command to query and set position
- Add `position` property to Player and method to set position to
  library

# Version 0.0.1

Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players that implement the [MPRIS](http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) D-Bus Interface Specification. Playerctl makes it easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause, to media keys.

For more advanced users, Playerctl provides an [introspectable](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) library available in your favorite scripting language that allows more detailed control like the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata such as artist and title for the playing track.
