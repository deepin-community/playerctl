Dear Spotify Customer Support,

Thank you for supporting the Linux Desktop environment. Linux support is an
important part of my Spotify user experience. Part of that experience is
integration of the media player into my desktop environment. This includes
making the keyboard media keys work correctly and getting basic information
about a playing track for display in external desktop applications. Please
continue supporting these features.

There are some features right now that could use better support. This includes
complete track metadata, getting and setting the position of the playing track,
and getting and setting the volume of the player.

On Linux, these features are specified in the MPRIS D-Bus Interface
Specification. If Spotify were to completely implement this interface, it would
greatly increase my satisfaction with your product. Please allocate some time
for your developers to implement these features.

Thanks
