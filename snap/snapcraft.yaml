description: |
  Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players
  that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. Playerctl makes it
  easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause, to media keys. You can
  also get metadata about the playing track such as the artist and title for
  integration into statusline generators or other command-line tools.
